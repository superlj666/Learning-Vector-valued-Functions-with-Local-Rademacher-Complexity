### Experiments for "Learning Vector-valued Functions with Local Rademacher Complexity"
## Step :
1. Run tune_parameter.m to obtain optimal parameters for tau_A, tau_I and tau_S.
2. Run tune_gaussian_kernel.m to obtain optimal Gaussian kernel for random features. (Manually and record the optimal kernel is recorded in select_gaussian_kernel).
3. Run experiment_1.m and results are stored in './result/exp1/result_table.txt'
